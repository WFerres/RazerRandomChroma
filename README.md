Old small repository to randomly change the Razer Chroma effects of a Razer mouse on Linux using [Polychromatic](https://github.com/polychromatic/polychromatic).

Reuploading to Github after the platform it was hosted on closed, and edited to use Polychromatic instead of Uchroma.

Rename the config.sample.php file to config.php and make any tweak you want to it, then fire using PHP CLI on main.php
